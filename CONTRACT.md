# principal-store — API contract

`127.0.0.1:8314`. The registry of principals: the humans and groups a permission
can be granted to and a card can be assigned to. This store hands out the id
everything else joins on.

Module `github.com/kayushkin/principal-store`, root package `principalstore`,
binary `cmd/principal-store` installed at `~/bin/principal-store`. Env:
`PRINCIPAL_STORE_ADDR` (default `127.0.0.1:8314`), `PRINCIPAL_STORE_DATA_DIR`
(default `~/.config/principal-store`). SQLite at
`<data dir>/principal-store.db`, WAL, `?_foreign_keys=on`.

Routes are rooted at `/`, the same as prediction-store, quote-store and
job-store; dash adds the `/api/principals` prefix and the auth this service has
none of. All timestamps are epoch seconds (`INTEGER`, 0 = unset).

**The bind is `127.0.0.1`, deliberately, and it is part of this contract.** The
older store siblings bind `*`; this one must not, because it has no auth of its
own and the front door (dash) is the only door. The unit sets
`PRINCIPAL_STORE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8314`, `settings.go` defaults to the same, and
`deploy.sh` fails if the port is listening anywhere else. Nothing off-host may
reach this service directly.

Build with `-tags sqlite_fts5`. The schema creates an FTS5 virtual table, so a
binary built without the tag starts and dies at the first boot with `no such
module: fts5` — `Open()` says so and names the flag.

## The three tables

### `principals`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `principal_000001`. What every other store joins on |
| `seq` | monotonic, assigned here; generates `id` and is the FTS rowid |
| `kind` | `human` \| `group`. Fixed at creation; enforced in Go against `kind.go` |
| `display_name` | required. Display only — never a join key, and not unique |
| `email` | humans, free text, trimmed. **Not unique and never a join key** — two rows may share one |
| `disabled_at` | 0 = active. The only removal; see below |
| `availability` | a human's declared working week in their own zone, `{"tzid","days","start","end"}` — the same shape as kanban-store's board `business_hours`, but the person's, so a Los Angeles board can have an Amsterdam member. **Absent means unknown, and unknown is never available.** Never defaulted. A group never carries one; see [Availability](#availability) |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | |
| **`groups`** | **computed on read** by `GET /principals/{id}` for a human: the groups it belongs to. Always present for a human, `[]` when none |
| **`members`** | **computed on read** by `GET /principals/{id}` for a group: the humans in it. Always present for a group, `[]` when none |

Exactly one of `groups` / `members` is present, so a reader can tell the kind
from the shape as well as from `kind`. Neither is expanded by `GET /principals`.

### `group_members`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `group_id` | a `kind=group` principal. A human here is a 400 |
| `member_id` | a `kind=human` principal. A group here is a 400: **no nested groups in v1** |
| `created_at` | |

`(group_id, member_id)` is the primary key and the insert is `INSERT OR IGNORE`,
so adding the same member twice is idempotent.

### `time_off`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `timeoff_000001`. Nothing joins on it, so this table **is** hard-deleted |
| `principal_id` | a `kind=human` principal. A group here is a 400 |
| `starts_at` / `ends_at` | half-open `[starts_at, ends_at)`, epoch seconds, `starts_at < ends_at`. Overlaps are allowed — two reasons to be away on one day are still one day away |
| `note` | free text, trimmed |
| `created_at` | |

An absence sits beside the week rather than editing it, so a holiday is one
row and not a rewrite of the schedule and a second rewrite to restore it.

### `principal_resources` — gone

Lived here from 2026-09-10 to 2026-09-11 as "what a principal works with", and
moved to **grant-store** (`:8315`) as the advisory `works_with` relation beside
the enforced `can_use`, `can_run_as` and `can_dispatch_on` grants, so there is
one place that says who may use what. The schema drops the table on boot; it
held no rows on any live database when it went. `GET /principals/{id}/resources`
and its `PUT`/`DELETE`, and `GET /resource-types`, answer Go's plain 404 now —
read `GET {grant-store}/principals/{id}/effective?relation=works_with` instead.

---

## Invariants

**`kind` is `human` or `group`.** Anything else is a **400** naming the
vocabulary. Case is normalised, nothing else is. `GET /kinds` serves the list so
no caller hardcodes it.

**Memberships are one level deep.** `group_id` must be a group and `member_id`
must be a human, checked in Go on every write and read of a membership because a
`CHECK` cannot look across rows. Putting a group in the member slot is a **400**
that says nested groups are not supported in v1 and to add the group's humans
directly.

**`display_name` is required** on every write path. The name is the only thing
a card or a permission can render, and a row that renders as nothing is
indistinguishable from a broken join.

**There is no hard delete.** No route and no store method removes a row.
`disabled_at` is the only removal: a disabled principal still exists so every
reference from another store keeps resolving. Disabled principals are hidden
from `GET /principals`, `GET /principals/{id}/members`, `GET /principals/{id}/groups`
and the embedded `groups` / `members` unless `include_disabled=true`, and
`GET /principals/{id}` **always** returns them, with `disabled_at` set, because a
card assigned to them still needs to render. `disable` and `enable` are
idempotent: a second `disable` does not move the timestamp.

**`kind` and `disabled_at` do not move through `PATCH`.** `kind` is fixed at
creation (a group that became a human would strand its memberships — create a
new principal). `disabled_at` moves only through `POST /disable` and
`POST /enable`, so removal is always an explicit act. Either key in a `PATCH`
body is a **400** saying so.

**A week without a zone is refused.** `availability.tzid` must be a zone this
host can load — `Europe/Amsterdam`, not `+02:00` — because an offset cannot know
what happens at a DST change and silently drifts the hours twice a year.
`TestAvailabilityIsReadInThePrincipalsOwnZoneAcrossDST` pins it: the same UTC
instant on the Mondays either side of 2026-03-29 is `off_hours` before and
`in_hours` after.

**Ids are prefixed, never bare UUIDs.** dash's resolver probes every registry
row whose id pattern matches, and noteboard already claims the uuid shape, so a
uuid-shaped id here would make every uuid in every chat message probe this store
as well. The prefix also keeps `/` out of the ref, which kanban-store's reverse
lookup splits on.

---


## Contacts

A third kind, beside `human` and `group`: **`contact`** is someone outside this
deployment that work arrives *from* — the requester on a ticket. A contact
never logs in, never holds a grant, never joins a group and is never an
administrator; `ActsInThisDeployment(kind)` is the check, and grant-store and
the login path both ask it.

`POST /contacts/resolve {"email":…,"display_name":…}` turns an address into one
id: **201** with `{"contact":…,"created":true}` the first time that address is
seen, **200** with `created:false` every time after. Matching is on the address
lowercased and trimmed, among active contacts only — so a requester who writes
from their phone in capitals lands on the row their earlier tickets point at,
and an employee who also writes in as a customer is deliberately two rows.

An existing contact **keeps the name it has**: the name on a later mail is not
more true than the one already stored, and overwriting it would rewrite the
requester shown on every one of that person's tickets.

⚠️ This is the only write path in this store that looks a principal up by
anything but its id. That is the point of it: the caller has an address and no
id, and this is where the address becomes one, once.

## The administrator

A human may carry `is_administrator`. It is one fact about a person, and the
services that read it — kanban-store, grant-store, llm-bridge-server — let an
administrator past every per-resource check they make: every board, every
grant, every session, granted or not. This store only records it.

- Read it on `GET /principals/{id}` and in every list.
- Set it with `PATCH /principals/{id} {"is_administrator":true}`; a patch that
  does not mention it leaves it alone.
- A **group** is refused it (400): a group is a set of people, not someone who
  acts.
- It says nothing on its own. A disabled principal is refused before this is
  read, so disabling an administrator removes the access.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | `{"status":"ok","counts":{principals,humans,groups,disabled}}`. Every count is over all rows, disabled included. `principals` counts every kind, so it is `humans + groups` plus the `contact` rows, which have no count of their own |
| GET | `/settings` | every environment variable the service reads, as llm-bridge `msg.ServiceSettings`: the value in force, its default and where it came from. Read-only: no setting is editable and `PUT /settings/{key}` is not mounted |
| GET | `/kinds` | `["human","group"]` |
| GET | `/availability-reasons` | `["in_hours","off_hours","time_off","no_schedule","disabled"]` |
| GET | `/weekday-codes` | `["MO","TU","WE","TH","FR","SA","SU"]` |
| GET | `/principals` | `q` (search, below), `kind`, `include_disabled`, `limit`, `offset`, `available_at` (epoch seconds; present and empty = now) → a **bare array** `[Principal]`, display-name order, memberships not expanded. An unknown `kind` is a **400** naming the vocabulary. `available_at` keeps only the humans available then — it implies `kind=human`, and `kind=group` beside it is a **400** |
| POST | `/principals` | `{kind, display_name, email?}` → **201** with the row |
| GET | `/principals/{id}` | the row plus `groups` (human) or `members` (group). Answers for a disabled principal. `include_disabled` governs whether disabled rows appear in the embedded list |
| PATCH | `/principals/{id}` | `display_name`, `email`, `availability`. `availability` is an object `{tzid, days, start, end}` to replace the week, `{}` or `null` to clear it, absent to leave it alone; a group is a **400**, as is a key inside the object that is not one of the four. `kind` and `disabled_at` are each a **400** naming what does move them; any other key is a **400** naming the three accepted |
| POST | `/principals/{id}/disable` | **200** with the row. Idempotent |
| POST | `/principals/{id}/enable` | **200** with the row. Idempotent |
| GET | `/principals/{id}/members` | group → `[Principal]` of humans. **400** if the id is a human. `include_disabled` as above. With `available_at` (epoch seconds; present and empty = now) only the members available then, and `include_disabled` is ignored — a disabled member is never available. **This is the read kanban-store's assignment pool makes** |
| PUT | `/principals/{group}/members/{member}` | no body. **201** `{"group_id","member_id","created":true}` the first time, **200** with `"created":false` after. **400** if `{group}` is not a group or `{member}` is not a human; **404** if either is missing |
| DELETE | `/principals/{group}/members/{member}` | **204**. **404** if not a member, or if either id is missing |
| GET | `/principals/{id}/groups` | human → `[Principal]` of groups. **400** if the id is a group (a group has no groups: no nesting). `include_disabled` as above |
| GET | `/principals/{id}/availability` | `?at=` epoch seconds, default now → `{"principal_id","at","available","reason"}`. Answers for a disabled human (`reason: disabled`). A group is a **400** pointing at `/members?available_at=`; a non-integer `at` is a **400** |
| GET | `/principals/{id}/time-off` | `[TimeOff]`, soonest first. **400** if the id is a group |
| POST | `/principals/{id}/time-off` | `{starts_at, ends_at, note?}` → **201** with the row. **400** if the range is empty or backwards, or the id is a group |
| DELETE | `/principals/{id}/time-off/{timeOffID}` | **204**. **404** if the row is not that principal's — a row cannot be removed through another principal's path |

Errors are `{"error":"…"}` and enumerate the valid values, so an agent reading a
400 can retry without guessing. **400** the caller described the record wrongly
(an unknown kind, a blank `display_name`, the wrong kind on either side of a
membership, a nested group, a forbidden or unknown `PATCH` key, a malformed
search query, a week a clock cannot read, a backwards absence, hours or time
off on a group) / **404** no such principal, or no such membership on `DELETE` /
**500** otherwise.

Request bodies are decoded with unknown fields rejected, so a misspelled key is
a 400 rather than a write that silently drops it. `PATCH` reaches the same
answer by a different route: it reads the body as a map so it can name the
forbidden keys, which defeats `DisallowUnknownFields`, so it then checks the
remaining keys against its own allowlist by hand. A `PATCH` of
`{"display_nmae":"…"}` is a 400, not a 200 that changed nothing.

---

## Search

`q` is matched against an FTS5 index over `display_name` and `email`, kept true
by triggers on insert, update and delete, keyed on `seq`.

**Bare words are prefix terms.** `q=pri` finds Priya Raman and `q=priya northwind`
finds her by name and email domain together, because the main caller is an
assignee picker reading keystrokes and FTS5's default whole-token match would
find her only once the whole name was typed. Anything that already carries FTS5
syntax — a double quote, `*`, `:`, parentheses, or an uppercase `AND` / `OR` /
`NOT` / `NEAR` — is passed through exactly as written. So `q="Slava Kayushkin"`
(quotes included, URL-encoded) is an exact phrase match, which is what
`scripts/seed-sample-principals.sh` relies on; note that a phrase can still
over-match (`"Data Team"` also finds `Data Team Leads`), so an exact-name lookup
narrows the result by `display_name` on the caller's side.

The expression is probed before the listing query runs, so a malformed one is a
**400** naming the query rather than a 500 from inside the handler.

---

## Availability

Added 2026-09-11 so kanban-store can hand a new card to someone who is
actually working, not to whoever the board names as its default. Two parts:

- **The week** — `availability` on the human: `{"tzid":"Europe/Amsterdam",
  "days":["MO","TU","WE","TH","FR"],"start":"09:00","end":"17:00"}`. Day codes
  are RFC 5545 and served at `GET /weekday-codes`; `start` and `end` are
  `HH:MM` in that zone, `start < end`, and the window is half-open (`17:00`
  itself is off hours).
- **Absences** — `time_off` rows, half-open epoch ranges beside the week.

`GET /principals/{id}/availability?at=` reduces both to one answer, and exactly
one reason applies, checked in this order:

| `reason` | `available` | when |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | false | `disabled_at` is set, whatever the hours say |
| `no_schedule` | false | the human has no `availability`. **Unknown is never available** — there is no default zone, because a guessed zone makes someone look free at 3am and an assignment made on that guess is worse than none |
| `time_off` | false | a `time_off` row covers `at` |
| `off_hours` | false | outside the week, read in the human's own zone |
| `in_hours` | **true** | inside it |

`GET /principals?available_at=` and `GET /principals/{group}/members?available_at=`
are the same evaluation over a list. Because the week is read in Go, the page
(`limit`, `offset`) is cut **after** the filter, so a page of ten is ten
available humans and not three with seven hiding behind the next offset.

There is no measured presence here — no "last seen", no heartbeat. The first
consumer is the Northwind simulation, whose people are not real, so the
declared week is the whole signal. If presence is ever wanted it is a
separate, written-by-others table, not a change to this one.

## Seed data

`scripts/seed-sample-principals.sh`, installed by `deploy.sh` as
`~/bin/seed-sample-principals`, creates:

- humans: **Slava Kayushkin** (`slava@kayushkin.com` — the operator; real, not
  a sample), **Priya Raman**, **Marcus Feld**, **Dinesh Okonkwo**, **Helena Vos**
  (`@northwind-eng.example` — the names already in kanban's `card_events.actor`
  from the Northwind demo)
- groups: **Data Team**, **Security**
- memberships: Priya, Dinesh → Data Team; Helena, Marcus → Security; Slava → both

It is idempotent — each principal is looked up by exact `display_name` and
`kind` before it is created — and exits non-zero if two rows ever match one
lookup rather than seeding memberships onto the wrong row. It prints one line per
principal, `principal_000001  human  Slava Kayushkin`.
