# puts one of them on time off for the current week, and puts all four in a
# "Northwind Eng" group, so a kanban board whose assignment_pool names that group
# has someone available at most hours and someone to skip. The operator gets no
# week: the operator is a real person, and a declared week would make them look available

# before it is created; a second run finds them all and creates nothing. If two
# rows ever match one lookup the script exits non-zero instead of guessing,
# because a guess here would seed memberships onto the wrong row.
