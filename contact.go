// Resolving a requester to one id.
//
// Mail arrives with a sender address and nothing else. A ticket must point at
// its requester by id — an address is a name, and a person who mails from a
// phone, a work account and a web form is three names for one requester — so
// the address has to become an id exactly once, and every later mail from that
// address has to find the same row.
//
// That is what ResolveContact does. It is deliberately the only write path
// that looks a principal up by anything but its id: the caller has an address
// and no id, which is the one moment where a lookup by name is the correct
// thing to do rather than a shortcut.
//
// Matching is on the address, lowercased and trimmed, among active contacts.
// It never matches a human or a group: an employee who also writes in as a
// customer is deliberately two rows, because one of them can log in and the
// other must never be able to.

// ContactResolution is what ResolveContact answers: the contact, and whether
// this call is what created it. Created is not decoration — a caller that
// suddenly creates a contact per message has a normalisation bug, and this is
// the field that shows it.
