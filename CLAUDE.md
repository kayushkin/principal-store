# About principal-store

## What it owns

`:8314`. The registry of *principals*: the things a permission is granted to and a card is assigned to. It gives every person, group and outside contact one id (`principal_000001`, registered in kanban-store's entity-type registry) for other stores to join on — before it, a person appeared as three different handles in three stores with nothing linking them. **What a principal may use is not here — it is in grant-store.** Routes are rooted at `/`. `CONTRACT.md` is the route table.

## Where this prompt lives

These sections are stored in agent-store as a project prompt collection and rendered, with identical text, to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the root of this repo, so that whichever file a harness reads it gets the same thing. Edit them on dash `/files`, or edit either rendered file: the 15-minute scan carries the edit back into the sections and out to the other file. The host prompt keeps one row for this repo with only what an agent elsewhere needs.

# How it works

## Principals, kinds and groups

`principals` carries `kind`, `display_name`, `email` (not unique), `disabled_at` and `is_administrator`. The kinds are served by `GET /kinds` — `human`, `group`, `contact` — and callers read them from there. `group_members` holds membership; **groups do not nest**. `GET /principals/{id}/members` lists a group's members and `GET /principals/{id}/groups` a principal's groups; `PUT` and `DELETE /principals/{group}/members/{member}` change them. `GET /principals?q=` is prefix search.

## No hard delete

A principal is never deleted: `POST /principals/{id}/disable` stamps `disabled_at` and `/enable` clears it. **A disabled row still resolves by id**, so a card, grant or ticket that points at it keeps working. `time_off` is the one table whose rows are hard-deleted.

## Contacts

A `contact` is someone outside this deployment that work arrives from — the requester on a ticket. A contact never logs in, never holds a grant, never joins a group and is never an administrator; `ActsInThisDeployment(kind)` is the check, and grant-store and the login path both ask it. `POST /contacts/resolve {"email":…,"display_name":…}` turns an address into one id: **201** with `created:true` the first time the address is seen, **200** with `created:false` after. It matches the address lowercased and trimmed, among active contacts only — an employee who also writes in as a customer is deliberately two rows. An existing contact **keeps the name it has**; overwriting it would rewrite the requester shown on every one of that person's tickets. ⚠️ This is the only write path here that finds a principal by anything but its id. That is its purpose; do not add a second.

## The administrator

A human may carry `is_administrator`. kanban-store, grant-store and llm-bridge-server read it and let an administrator past every per-resource check they make. This store only records it: read it on any principal, set it with `PATCH /principals/{id} {"is_administrator":true}` (a patch that does not mention it leaves it alone). A **group** is refused it with a 400. A disabled principal is refused by those services before the flag is read, so disabling an administrator removes the access.

## Availability

A human may declare an `availability` — the working week in their own zone, `{tzid, days, start, end}`, the same shape as a kanban board's `business_hours` — plus `time_off` rows (`timeoff_000001`, half-open epoch ranges). `GET /principals/{id}/availability?at=` reduces both to `{available, reason}`; the reasons are served at `GET /availability-reasons` and checked in this order: `disabled` → `no_schedule` → `time_off` → `off_hours` → `in_hours`. `?available_at=` on `GET /principals` and on a group's `/members` applies the same test to a list, and pages **after** the filter. **No schedule is unknown, and unknown is never available; there is no default zone and no measured presence.** Built for kanban-store's assignment pool (kanban card `31d1d990-1c41-4725-bdd5-bd2fe926ba7b`).

# Access and operations

## Who may call it

**No authentication, so it binds 127.0.0.1 only** (`PRINCIPAL_STORE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8314` in the unit) — unlike most of its siblings, which listen on every interface. Do not widen the bind address without adding auth first. dash proxies it at `/api/principals/*` (`dash/server/api_principals.go`), behind dash's login. Unit `principal-store.service`, binary `~/bin/principal-store`. `~/bin/seed-sample-principals` (source `scripts/seed-sample-principals.sh`) seeds sample people and groups.

# Working in this repo

## Build, test and deploy

Module `github.com/kayushkin/principal-store`, root package `principalstore`, server in `cmd/principal-store`. SQLite at `~/.config/principal-store/principal-store.db`. ⚠️ **`go test` and `go build` need `-tags sqlite_fts5`**, or every test fails on `no such module: fts5`; the `Makefile` and `deploy.sh` set it. `schema.sql` still carries `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS principal_resources`: that table held a "works with" list that now lives in grant-store as the `works_with` relation, and its old routes answer a plain 404.

## Generated TypeScript types

The wire types are rendered to TypeScript, not copied: `./generate-ts.sh` runs tygo over the root package (`tygo.yaml` excludes `store.go`) and writes `ts/model.ts`, published source-only as `@kayushkin/principal-store-types` (`file:../principal-store/ts`). A type must live outside `store.go` to be rendered — `Principal`, `Patch` and `Counts` are in `principal.go`, and the membership answer is the named type `GroupMembership` so its route has a type. bridge-ui consumes the package through this main clone, so a missing `ts/package.json` breaks `tsc` there.
